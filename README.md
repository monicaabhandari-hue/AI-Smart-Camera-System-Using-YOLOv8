# AI-Smart-Camera-System-Using-YOLOv8
This repository contains the code, results, and documentation for my Capstone project. The goal of the project was to build a real-time smart camera system capable of detecting objects using the YOLOv8 deep learning model.

Project Summary
I trained the YOLOv8n model using the COCO 2017 dataset and evaluated its performance using metrics such as mAP50, mAP50–95, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. The project also included real-time testing using a webcam to demonstrate the smart camera concept.
